This is Apollo Android documentation for how things work under the hood. The user-facing documentation about how to use Apollo Android is available at https://www.apollographql.com/docs/android/.

This internal documentation is work in progress. It is used for brainstorming/communication but might be lagging sometimes, feel free to send PRs!
